Legend of Zelda themed total conversion mod for Dwarf Fortress

The mod was originally based on Knight Otu's Dwarves in a New World, and incorporates some stuff from Putnam's Earthward Pick branch of the mod, as well as minor bits of moddery from other modders. 

Features:

This mod plays basically like normal DF, with one big change: Since most tribes in LoZelda are surface-dwelling, only a few have easy access to digging tools.  The other tribes need to trade for digging implements from one of the digging-enabled ones.

Consequently, I suggest bringing a large store of metal ore with you on embark, so that you can make metal goods while until you can get caravan trade going.

Tribes:

Ocarina of Time Tribes
Hyrulean: This is the tribe I typically play as for fortress mode.  This is civ a mixed tribe of humans and hylians.  They have full metallurgy enabled, but no digging.  They can be asked to bring ores for trade.  The Hyrulean civ is led by a King or Queen.

Hylian:  Hylians have 2x skill learn rates, don't forget skills or suffer from skill rust, above average strength, agility, and toughness, and have 8 ranks in Magic Nature (representing their connection to the Triforce and the holy land).  They can be asked to bring ores for trade.  The Hylian civ is somewhat Templar-themed: They focus on blunt weapons and are led by a Sage of Time

Human: Adventure-mode only.  These are DF-standard humans, including their factitious government.

Kokiri: Kokiri use metal weapons and grown-wood equipment.  They will bring exotic animals to trade, wafers of fairy steel, and will probably also bring green magic potions.  As with DF-elves, they will get insulted if you try to offer them wood-products in trade.  Because their weapons and pets are better than that of DF-elves, though, it is probably worth it to humor them.  In combat, they are handicapped by their small size and lousy armor.  However, they tend to rise from the dead as stalfos, poes, and haunted trees.

Gorons:  Gorons are a digging enabled tribe (mole mits).  They also have full metallurgy, and can be asked to bring stones and ores in trade.  Some gorons are gigantic.  If a goron is described as incredibly broad or tall, it may be up to 10x larger than typical members of its species.  Gorons use the wrestling skill for their unarmed attacks, and attack using headbutts and body-slams.  Gorons have an energy-efficient rolling gait that they can use for transit.  In adventure mode, a PC goron can use the rolling gait to travel 5x faster than default (though they can't do this via fast-travel mode, you have to stay in regular mode).  Gorons can't swim, and will probably drown if they fall into water.

Zoras: Zoras can craft furniture and building blocks from various creature materials at the furniture workshop, though they won't bring them in trade.  In trade, they bring their most useful good is probably their Heavy Crossbows and improved bolts (long bolts and broad-tipped bolts). Zoras have 3 castes, normal zoras, delphin zoras (Mikau/Zora Link from Majora's Mask), and fancy zoras (Princess Ruto/Lulu). All zoras have decent natural attacks, which they use their Swimming skill for. Basic zoras use a bite attack, fighting zoras have bladed fins and a head-butt attack, and fancy zoras have poisonous spines in their fins, similar to those of the lion fish (the venom causes localized pain and swelling, systemic pain, nausea, and dizziness, and in high doses death by paralysis of the lungs). Zoras get a speed boost in water.

Sheikah: Sheikah are a digging enabled tribe (kusari-kuwa). Their weapons are weaker then average, but crucially are mostly multi-attack-enabled.  They can be asked to bring ores for trade.  Castes with good natural attacks will benefit the most from using sheikah weapons.  Sheikah ranged weapons mostly use small darts as ammunition, and so are not as effective as bows and crossbows.  In combat, shiekah use martial-arts moves based on the Melee combat skill, so any trained fighter will be able to make effective unarmed attacks as well.  Because of their high Ambusher skill, most sheikah civilians are hunters, and so armed with a ranged weapon.

Desert Gerudo:  Gerudo do not have access to the sawmill, but if they embark on a map with clay they can make sun-fired bricks without using consuming fuel.  They also have a building that allows them to produce charcoal at 4x efficiency.  They can be asked to bring ores for trade.  Gerudo generally have increased strength, agility, endurance, and toughness.  Gerudo also have a number of rare castes:

Ice Sorceresses: Immortal, coldproof, and able to periodically shoot globs of ice.

Ice Sorceresses: Immortal, fireproof, and able to periodically shoot globs of 'fire'.  I've found DF's actual fireballs and fire behavior to be SUPER annoying, so their globs of 'fire' aren't hot and don't catch anything on fire.

Gerudo kings:  Rare, immortal, fireproof male caste.  Able to periodically shoot globs of 'fire'.

Sister of the Ancient Cistern:  4-armed gerudo female.  Living version of the 4 armed stalmaster from the Ancient Cistern.

Sister of the Desert Sand:  A gerudo female with a snake tail in place of legs.  Nominally inspired by the Desert Colossus, in actual point of fact I mostly just wanted to make a Naga caste.  Has a side-winding gait that can be used to travel long distances at high speed.  Has a tail-slap attack capable of dealing serious damage and knocking opponents flying.

Other Tribes
Korokri:  Humanoid race intermediate between Ocarina kokiri and Wind Waker koroks.  In appearance, they look like Kokiri without fairies and with a layer of wood over their lower arms and legs.  In battle, they are able to make piercing and slashing attacks with their wood layers, but don't rise from the dead.

Yeti: Digging enabled tribe (mole mits). Large humanoid race.  Based on the Twilight Princess yeti, but not yet particularly detailed in terms of coloration or of the pretty extreme dimorphism between Yeto and Yeta.  They can be asked to bring ores for trade.

Feathered Zora: Digging enabled tribe (long-hafted pick).  Humanoid race intermediate between Ocarina zoras and Wind Waker Rito.  They also have 3 castes: feathered zora, beaked zora, and flying zora.  Feathered zora have large bird talons, with which they can make rather nasty natural attacks.  Beaked zora are squidlike in form.  They have 4 grasping tentacles and 4 stance tentacles, as well as a number of secondary tentacles, in addition to their namesake beaks.  Flying zora can't actually fly (due to DF's bugged flier pathfinding).  Instead, they have a special "Burst of Speed" gait that they can use to quickly reach high speed for jumps.  They also have talons, beaked noses that can make peck attacks, and can bash foes with their wing-fins.  They can be asked to bring ores for trade.

Sheikah Heretics: Baby-stealing tribe, therefore they will be hostile to most other tribes. Digging enabled tribe (Pick).  Similar to regular Sheikah, with the addition of Haunt castes that have no heads and floating arms.  They can be asked to bring ores for trade, if they are peaceful to you.

Marsh Gerudo:  Marsh Gerudo are based on Majora's Mask's Gerudo Pirates.  They don't have either of the two 'sister' castes, but are otherwise identical to Desert Gerudo.  They can be asked to bring ores for trade.

Twili:  There are two Twili civs: A peaceful town-dwelling civ led by a king or queen, and a baby-snatching dark tower civ led by a demon.  Twili are semi-insubstantial in nature: their heads and hands are real, but the rest of their body is just a thin layer of skin over a non-existent core.  Consequently, they can be difficult to fight as their most vulnerable spots are harder to hit.  Twili come in two broad types, twili commoners and twili nobles.  The noble castes are more powerful, as they are larger and have a piece of magic armor that mutates their hair or one of their limbs.  In fortress mode, twili produce building materials for free at their Twilight Temples, which is important because they don't have axes and aren't digging enabled.

Moblins: Moblins are quite similar to vanilla goblins.  They come in three main sizes: small bokoblins, regular moblins, and large great moblins.  There are several moblin civs, each led by a different demon lord.  They both snatch babies and steal items, so no other tribe is peaceful to them.

Ikana Undead

Deku Scrubs: Item-theft+ambush tribe.  Use wooden weapons and armor and spit wooden projectiles.

Garo:  Item-theft+ambush tribe.  When they die, they burst into flames.
